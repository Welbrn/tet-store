# My Store

This is a simple e-commerce application built with React.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
